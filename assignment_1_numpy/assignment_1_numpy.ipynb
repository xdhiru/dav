Data Type - Numpy array are designed for storing and manipulating homogeneous data. While python liste can comes store at any type of data, the flexibility of lists comes at a performance cost.\n","<br>b. Performance - Numpy arrays are typically much faster than python lists for numerical operations because they are stored in contegeous memory and are optimised for vectorised operations.\n","<br>c.
